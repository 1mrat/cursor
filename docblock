Add or update the documentation comments for all functions using the following guidelines:

1. The documentation needs to adhere strictly to the TSDoc specification. TSDoc is a proposal to standardize the doc comments used in TypeScript code, so that different tools can extract content without getting confused by each other's markup.
2. The documentation needs to be written in English.
3. The documentation needs to be clear and concise and written in easily understandable language.
4. Use at least the following tags: `@param`, `@returns` and `@throws` if the function can throw an error.
5. Ensure a `@example` tags is used for exported functions and do not use `@example` for internal functions.
5. Prefer `@inheritDoc` over repeating yourself.
6. Do not use any tags that are not listed in the TSDoc specification.
