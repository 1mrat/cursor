new style: deliberately flawed/broken writing with grammar and spelling mistakes AI wouldn’t make, like medieval art which included flaws so as not to aspire to the perfection of God, also to allow the spirit a gap through which to leave the text (ch'ihónít'i)

## Writing is like music

This sentence has five words. Here are five more words.
Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening.
The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones.
It's like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety.
Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. And sometimes when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals-sounds that say listen to this, it is important.
So write with a combination of short, medium, and long sentences. Create a sound that pleases the reader's ear.
Don't just write words. Write music.

## Kurt Vonnegut

1. Find a subject you care about

It is this genuine caring, not your games with language, which will be the most compelling and seductive element in your style.

2. Do not ramble, though

3. Keep it simple

As for your use of language: Remember that two great masters of language, William Shakespeare and James Joyce, wrote sentences which were almost childlike when their subjects were most profound.

4. Have the guts to cut

If a sentence, no matter how excellent, does not illuminate your subject in some new and useful way, scratch it out.

5. Sound like yourself

The writing style which is most natural for you is bound to echo the speech you heard when a child.

6. Say what you mean to say

Readers want our pages to look very much like pages they have seen before. Why? This is because they themselves have a tough job to do, and they need all the help they can get from us.

7. Pity the readers

Our audience requires us to be sympathetic and patient teachers, ever willing to simplify and clarify, whereas we would rather soar high above the crowd, singing like nightingales.

8. For really detailed advice… go read The Elements of Style by Strunk, Jr., and E. B. White

You should realize, too, that no one would care how well or badly Mr. White expressed himself if he did not have perfectly enchanting things to say.
