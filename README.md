# Cursor

This is a repo of cursor prompts as text files without extension.

It allow you to quickly @ mention then in Cursor and keep your .cursorrules file small.


Just git clone to a prompts folder in your project:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/1mrat/cursor.git prompts
```

You can submit PRs to add your prompts.

## How to use this?

After you have cloned the repo into your project, just @mention the rule. Here is an example of me mentioning the @modes roles with the `funny` addition.
